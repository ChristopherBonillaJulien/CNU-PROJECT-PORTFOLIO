# Project 5 RAG system

## Create a RAG system that uses a document store (Chroma, FAISS, etc..), a retriever, a reranker, and a LLM generator to answer questions based on a custom document collection of your choice (100 or more pages). 
<strong>I have provided you with code for every step of this project. You may use any of it with the exception that you must choose new models for the embedder, reranker and the generator (you may not use mine).</strong><br>
<mark>You must demo this project to me in person (or google meet) before  Dec 15th. </mark><br><br>
Note: This is a good baseline for a capstone project but you would have to extend it, some suggestions:
<ul>
    <li> fine tuning embedder or reranker</li>
    <li> addding a parrallel key word search (BM-25) pipeline to make full hybrid search</li>                  
    <li> adding multi-modal document support (images, video, audio).  Especially tabular data, or detailed drawings or graphics</li>                  
    <li> adding LLM prompt tuning</li>
</ul>
